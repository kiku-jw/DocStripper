## Security Best Practices

DocStripper processes files locally and:
- ✅ Does not send data to external servers
- ✅ Works completely offline
- ✅ Creates backup files before modifications
- ✅ Provides undo functionality

However, always:
- Review files before processing
- Keep backups of important documents
- Test on copies before processing originals
